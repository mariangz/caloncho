# Caloncho

First project of the [Responsive Web Design Certification by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Motivation

The idea was to build a site, based on what was learned during the course at freeCodeCamp, that would pass the requested requirements. I decided to buil a site about a Mexican artist, Caloncho, and to express in the design of the site my inspiration for his "Tropical" style and particularly for the cover of his ep "Palmar" .

## General Info

I started designing with "mobile first" in mind. Then I used flexbox. I tried to create something simple without many additions but also without neglecting its design.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
